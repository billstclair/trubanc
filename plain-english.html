<h1>Trubanc in Plain English</h1>

<p>
<a href="viewtext.php?file=doc/db.txt">doc/db.txt</a> gives a terse
description of the Trubanc server database and protocol. This page
attempts to render the protocol in plain English.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc uses public key cryptography to sign all messages passed back
and forth between its web interface and the Trubanc server. Digital
signatures are a virtually unforgeable way to ensure that a message
was written by its purported author. Trubanc uses OpenSSL for its
public key cryptography. You probably use OpenSSL every time you visit
a secure web site, https://somewhere.com/, as does the web server. I
didn't roll my own. Just used the same tried and true technology that
secures the web. You can read more about public key cryptography,
digital signatures, and hashing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to use four actors in the scenarios that follow. "Bank" is
the name of the Trubanc server. "Bob" and "Sue" are two customers,
who will trade with each other. "Spammer" is a third customer, unknown
to Bob or Sue.
</p>

<h2>Scenario: Opening an Account</h2>

<p>
Sue (via email or IM): Hey, Bob. Check out Trubanc. Go to
Trubanc.com, download the client, and install it on your
computer. Then create a private key, and send me your ID, and I'll
give you some usage tokens so that you can create an account.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via email or IM): Thanks, Sue! I installed the Trubanc client
and created a private key. Here's my ID.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Sue (via her Trubanc client): Hey bank, Here's a new request
number. Give me a transaction number please.<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's a new transaction number.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Sue: Hey bank, here's that transaction number you gave me. Please
spend 50 usage tokens to Bob's ID, with a message of "Hey
Bob. Welcome to Trubanc!" I'm paying 2 usage tokens as a transaction
fee, which I'll get back when Bob accepts the spend.  My balance after
this transaction will be 1025 usage tokens. My outbox hash after this
transaction will be X.<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: I processed your spend of 50 usage tokens to Bob's ID. I agree
that the transaction fee at the time of this transaction is 2 usage
tokens, and that your balance after this transaction is 1025 usage
tokens. I agree with you on your outbox hash.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Sue (via email or IM): OK, Bob. I've given you 50 usage tokens. You
should now be able to create an account at Trubanc.com. Send me a
message via Trubanc when you've registered.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via his Trubanc client): Hello bank. Here's my ID and my public
key. What's your ID and public key?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's my ID and public key.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and my public key, please create an account for me.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've registered your ID and public key. Somebody gave you enough
tokens to register. Welcome to Trubanc.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
In order to sign a message, you need to have a private key. In order
to verify the signature on a message, you need to have the
corresponding public key. Trubanc identifies customers by the hash of
their public key, their ID. The ID is a 40-character string of numbers
and the letters A to F, the hexadecimal representation of a 160-bit
number. You identify your account to the Trubanc client with a
passphrase, which is used to encrypt your private key on your
disk. You'll only need to copy and paste your ID when you want to tell
a trading partner how to send you money for the first time, or to seed
your account with usage tokens, as Sue did for Bob.
</p>

<p>
Usage tokens are an idea from Patrick
Chkoreff's <a href="https://loom.cc/">Loom</a> system. They are a way
to charge for the bank's resources. You have to buy storage for your
account balances, and lease temporary storage for transactions. Usage
tokens are the "currency" used to do this. Trubanc also supports fees
in other asset types, for bank management that wants to make more than
the sale of usage tokens. Trubanc uses the file system as a
database. One file in the Trubanc database costs one usage
token. Files vary in size, but are usually about 8K, mostly
signatures.
</p>

<p>
Note that Bob had to send his public key to the bank twice, once when
he requested the bank's public key, and again when he
registered. Every message going to and from Trubanc is digitally
signed. It's only possible to verify a digital signature if you know
the public key of the signer. A new customer's public key isn't in the
database until after he's registered, so the first two messages, in
which the new customer gets the bank's public key, so that he can
verify the bank's signatures, and the registration request, both need
to include the customers's public key, so that the signatures on those
two messages can themselves be verified. After registration is
complete, subsequent messages need to carry only the ID; the public
key can then be looked up in the database.
</p>

parenthesized item omitted):<br>

Bank: (&lt;bankid>,@register,(&lt;bobsid>,register,&lt;bankid>,&lt;pubkey>,Bob))
</pre>

<h2>Scenario: Receiving Assets</h2>

<p>
Bob: Hello bank. Here's my ID and a new request number. What's in my
inbox?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Your inbox contains a 50 usage token spend from Sue with a
message of "Hey Bob. Welcome to Trubanc!" It also contains a 10 usage
token charge from the bank with a message of "Registration Fee". Here
are two transaction numbers you can use to accept these spends and do
a spend yourself.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and the first of the transaction numbers you gave
me. Accept the spend from Sue with a message of, "Thanks, Sue. I'm
excited about Trubanc!" Accept the bank charge. My balance after this
transaction will be 39 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've processed the spend from Sue and the bank charge. I agree
that your balance after this transaction is 39 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
One possible attack on an electronic bank can be for someone to replay
an intercepted message. Unless the protocol protects against that,
this can cause problems. Except for the bankid request, the
registration request, and a request for a customer's last request
number, every information request must be accompanied by a request
number that is larger than the customer's last used request number,
and every transaction must be accompanied by a transaction number that
is given out by the bank. The bank maintains a counter, which it
increments each time someone asks for a transaction number. This makes
requests that reveal information or initiate transactions impossible
to replay without a customer's passphrase and private key. In the
Trubanc world, your passphrase and your private key are your
identity. Guard them well.
</p>

<p>
Another possible replay attack is to intercept a message for one bank
and send it to another. Customers could protect against this by having
different IDs, hence different public/private key pairs, for different
banks. But it will be very convenient to use the same ID. Your friends
will recognize you, and you'll have only one passphrase to
remember. So the bank's ID is included in almost every request.
Requests meant for another bank will not work.
</p>

<p>
You're probably wondering why Bob's balance after the transaction is
39, instead of 40, usage tokens. He got 50 usage tokens from Sue, and
paid the bank 10 usage tokens for his registration fee. The additional
usage token is the price of the new file used to store the usage token
balance. Storage costs usage tokens. Loom charges 1 usage token for
each 16 bytes of storage. I considered charging per byte, but decided
that charging per file was easier to handle, though not quite as
fair. It only makes sense if message sizes are limited, of course. If
you were allowed megabyte messages, then Trubanc would have to charge
per byte, or per kilobyte.

<h2>Scenario: Closing a Transaction</h2>

<p>
Sue: Hello bank. Here's my ID and a new request number. What's in my
inbox?<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: Your inbox contains an acceptance from Bob of your 50 usage
token spend with a message of, "Thanks Sue. I'm excited about
Trubanc!" Here are two transaction numbers you can use to close that
transaction and do a new spend.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Sue: Here's my ID and the first of the transaction numbers you gave
me. Clear the spend to Bob. My balance after this transaction will be
1027 usage tokens. My outbox hash after this transaction will be Y.<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've cleared the spend to Bob (and refunded the usage tokens
that were leasing the outbox and inbox locations). I agree that your
balance after this transaction is 1027 usage tokens. And I agree that
your outbox hash after this transaction is Y.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
There are three main parts of a Trubanc account: the balances, the
outbox, and the inbox. Value is stored in all three places. When you
do a spend, your balance for the spent asset is debited, and the spend
request is stored in your outbox and in the recipients inbox. You are
charged two usage tokens to lease the new outbox and inbox files. When
the recipient accepts the spend, his balance for the spent asset is
credited, the spend notice is removed from his inbox, and a spend
acceptance notice is added to your inbox. When you acknowledge his
acceptance of the spend, the spend request is removed from your
outbox, the acceptance notice is removed from your inbox, and the two
usage tokens you paid to lease those files is credited to your
balance. This three step process is necessary, because the bank can't
modify your balances without your signed permission, and it can't
modify the recipient's balances without his signed permission.
</p>

<p>
You may be wondering what an "outbox hash" is. Your balances plus your
outbox represent the part of your account that you and the bank have
agreed upon. Your inbox is changed without your knowledge, but the
bank needs your signed permission to change your outbox (do a spend)
or your balances. Since your outbox might get large, instead of
sending the entire contents back and forth every time you do a spend,
or acknowledge the acceptance (or rejection) of a spend by a
recipient, you compute a hash of your outbox, and send that instead,
and the bank responds with an acknowledgement of that outbox hash
(thank you to Patrick Chkoreff for this idea).

<h2>Scenario: Preventing Spam</h2>

<p>
Spammer (likely via an automated client): Hey bank. Here's a new
request number. Give me a transaction number please.<br/>
Signed: Spammer
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's a new transaction number.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Spammer: Hey bank. Here's that transaction number you gave me. Please
spend 0 usage tokens to Bob's ID, with a message of, "Go all
night. Visit BuyViagra.com." I'm paying 2 usage tokens as a
transaction fee, which I'll get back when Bob accepts the spend. My
balance after this transaction will be 2425 usage tokens. My outbox
hash after this transaction will be Z.<br/>
Signed: Spammer
</p>

<p>
Bank: I processed your spend of 0 usage tokens to Bob's ID. I agree
that the transaction fee at the time of this transaction is 2 usage
tokens, and that your balance after this transaction is 2425 usage
tokens. I agree with you on your outbox hash.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Hello bank. Here's my ID and a new request number. What's in my
inbox?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Your inbox contains a 0 usage token spend from Spammer with a
message of, "Go all night. Visit BuyViagra.com." Here are two
transaction numbers you can use to accept these spends and do a spend
yourself.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and the first of the transaction numbers you gave
me. Reject the spend from Spammer with a message of, "Thanks for the
tokens", and give me the two usage tokens he paid to send that
spam. My balance after this transaction will be 41 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've rejected the spend from Spammer. I agree that your balance
after this transaction is 41 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
Spends can be rejected. The amount spent goes back to the spender, but
the recipient pockets the transaction fee. Zero spends use Trubanc as
a simple messaging service. But not a free one, unless the recipient
wants the message. IMHO, spam exists largely because it is nearly free
to send email. In a system where each spam message costs 2 usage
tokens, cheap but not free, I doubt it will be much of a problem. Time
will tell.

<h2>Scenario: Issuing Assets</h2>

<p>
Bob: Hey bank. Here's a new request number. Give me a transaction
number please.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's a new transaction number.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Hey bank. Here's that transaction number you gave me. Please
register a new asset named "Bob GoldGrams". It has a scale of 7 and a
precision of 3. Its ID is &lt;bobggid>. My balance after this transaction
will be 39 usage tokens and -1 &lt;bobggid>.
</p>

<p>
Bank: I have registered the new "Bob GoldGrams" asset. I agree that
your balance after this transaction is 39 usage tokens and
-1 &lt;bobggid>.
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
Like Loom, Trubanc allows customers to create their own asset
types. Then, if they can convince them to do so, other customers can
trade in that asset type. The ID of a Trubanc asset is the sha1 hash
of the creator's ID, its scale, its precision, and its name. But the
message the customer signs to create the asset, and that the bank
signs to acknowledge creation, also contains the bankid. This allows
the asset to be registered at multiple banks, with the same ID, but
makes each particular registration specific to a specific bank. Hence,
it makes sense for an asset issuer to provide a service of
transferring his holdings of his asset between banks at which he's
registered; it's self-evident that Bob GoldGrams at Bank A are
the same asset as Bob GoldGrams at bank B.
</p>

<p>
I plan to support transfer of asset issuance, but I haven't figured
out the intricacies yet.
</p>

<p>
Like Loom, all amounts in Trubanc are stored as integers. The scale
value controls where the decimal point goes in the real-world
representation of that value: move it left by scale places. The
precision controls the minimum number of decimal places that are
printed. So with a scale of 7 and a precision of 3, the value 12000000
will be printed by Trubanc clients as 1.200, and the minimum value for
Bob's new currency is 0.0000001, one ten-millionth of a gram of gold,
or $0.000003 at $30/gram: 3 ten-thousandths of a cent. Hello
micropayments.
</p>

<p>
Also like Loom, the sum of all the amounts, in accounts and outboxes,
for one asset type is -1. There is one negative balance, owned by the
issuer, who can spend as much as he wants, and a bunch of positive
balances, and outbox entries. A -1 balance in the issuer's account
means there are no outstanding balances or outbox entries in that
asset, so that's where Bob's Bob GoldGrams balance begins. Users of an
asset have to trust the issuer when he tells them, outside of Trubanc,
that his asset is backed by something of real value, and that he'll
never issue more of the virtual asset than he has in the backing
commodity. Well, unless he wants to act like a country, and issue fiat
currency that is backed by his Full Trust and Credit and nothing
else. Good luck getting people to go for that.

Bank: I have done your spend of 2.4056304 Bob GoldGrams to Sue, with
your message, and a transaction fee of 2 usage tokens. I agree that
your balance after this transaction is 36 usage tokens, and
309.6291376 Bob GoldGrams in your "Gun Safe" account. I agree on the
outbox hash.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc supports splitting up your balances into multiple
"accounts". Much like a conventional bank gives you a checking account
and a savings account, you can use these accounts to help manage your
assets. You can have as many of them as you wish, limited only by
having usage tokens to pay for the files.
</p>

<p>
Bob has decided to keep track of his Bob GoldGrams assets with a "Gun
Safe" account, with a balance recording how many grams of the gold in
his safe have not yet been put into circulation. He seeds it
with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=10+troy+ounces+in+grams">10
ounces</a> of gold, the part of his holdings that he's willing to
sell. Then he spends some of it to Sue, asking for enough Capulin
Coffee Units for two pounds of Capulin Coffee ($17.95 per pound,
shipped).
</p>

<p>
Note that you don't have to mention all of your balances with every
spend. You only mention the balances that change. Also notice that
there's no transaction fee for spends to yourself. Moving assets
between your accounts costs only tokens for new files. No need for
the outbox and inbox stuff.
