<h1>Trubanc in Plain English</h1>

<p>
<a href="viewtext.php?file=doc/db.txt">doc/db.txt</a> gives a very
terse description of the Trubanc server database and and
protocol. This page attempts to render that in plain English.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc uses public key cryptography to sign all messages passed back
and forth between its web interface and the Trubanc server. Digital
signatures are a virtually unforgeable way to ensure that a message
was written by its purported author. Trubanc uses OpenSSL for its
public key cryptography. You probably use OpenSSL every time you visit
a secure web site, https://somewhere.com/, as does the web server. I
didn't roll my own. Just used the same tried and true technology that
secures the web.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to use four actors in the scenarios that follow. "Bank" is
the name of the Trubanc server. "Bob" and "Sue" are two customers,
who will trade with each other. "Spammer" is a third customer, unknown
to Bob or Sue.
</p>

<h2>Scenario: Opening an Account</h2>

<p>
Sue (via email or Skype): Hey, Bob. Check out Trubanc. Go to
Trubanc.com, download the client, and install it on your
computer. Then create a private key, and send me your ID, and I'll
give you some usage tokens so that you can create an account.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via email or Skype): Thanks, Sue! I installed the Trubanc client
and created a private key. Here's my ID.
</p>

<p>
Sue (via email or Skype): OK, Bob. I've given you 20 usage tokens. You
should now be able to create an account at Trubanc.com. Here's my
ID. Send me a message via Trubanc when you've registered.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via the Trubanc client): Hello bank. Here's my ID and my public
key. What's your ID and public key?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's my ID and public key.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and my public key, please create an account for me.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've registered your ID and public key. Somebody gave you enough
tokens to register. Welcome to Trubanc.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>
