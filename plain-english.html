<h1>Trubanc in Plain English</h1>

<p>
<a href="viewtext.php?file=doc/db.txt">doc/db.txt</a> gives a terse
description of the Trubanc server database and protocol. This page
attempts to render the protocol in plain English.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc uses public key cryptography to sign all messages passed back
and forth between its web interface and the Trubanc server. Digital
signatures are a virtually unforgeable way to ensure that a message
was written by its purported author. Trubanc uses OpenSSL for its
public key cryptography. You probably use OpenSSL every time you visit
a secure web site, https://somewhere.com/, as does the web server. I
didn't roll my own. Just used the same tried and true technology that
secures the web. You can read more about public key cryptography,
digital signatures, and hashing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to use four actors in the scenarios that follow. "Bank" is
the name of the Trubanc server. "Bob" and "Sue" are two customers,
who will trade with each other. "Spammer" is a third customer, unknown
to Bob or Sue.
</p>

<h2>Scenario: Opening an Account</h2>

<p>
Sue (via email or IM): Hey, Bob. Check out Trubanc. Go to
Trubanc.com, download the client, and install it on your
computer. Then create a private key, and send me your ID, and I'll
give you some usage tokens so that you can create an account.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via email or IM): Thanks, Sue! I installed the Trubanc client
and created a private key. Here's my ID.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Sue (via her Trubanc client): Hey bank, Here's a new request
number. Give me a transaction number please.<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's a new transaction number.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Sue: Hey bank, here's that transaction number you gave me. Please
spend 50 usage tokens to Bob's ID, with a message of ""Hey
Bob. Welcome to Trubanc!" I'm paying 2 usage tokens as a transaction
fee, which I'll get back when Bob accepts the spend.  My balance after
this transaction will be 1025 usage tokens. My outbox hash after this
transaction will be X.<br/>
Signed: Sue
</p>

<p>
Bank: I processed your spend to Bob's ID. I agree that the transaction
fee at the time of this transaction is 2 usage tokens, and that your
balance after this transaction is 1025 usage tokens. I agree with you
on your outbox hash.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Sue (via email or IM): OK, Bob. I've given you 50 usage tokens. You
should now be able to create an account at Trubanc.com. Send me a
message via Trubanc when you've registered.
</p>

<p>
Bob (via his Trubanc client): Hello bank. Here's my ID and my public
key. What's your ID and public key?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Here's my ID and public key.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and my public key, please create an account for me.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've registered your ID and public key. Somebody gave you enough
tokens to register. Welcome to Trubanc.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>
In order to sign a message, you need to have a private key. In order
to verify the signature on a message, you need to have the
corresponding public key. Trubanc identifies customers by the hash of
their public key, their ID. The ID is a 40-character string of numbers
and the letters A to F, the hexadecimal representation of a 160-bit
number. You identify your account to the Trubanc client with a
passphrase, which is used to encrypt your private key on your
disk. You'll only need to copy and paste your ID when you want to tell
a trading partner how to send you money for the first time, or to seed
your account with usage tokens, as Sue did for Bob.
</p>

<p>
Usage tokens are an idea from Patrick
Chkoreff's <a href="https://loom.cc/">Loom</a> system. They are a way
to charge for the bank's resources. You have to buy storage for your
account balances, and temporary storage for transactions. Usage tokens
are the "currency" used to do this. Trubanc also supports fees in
other asset types, for bank management that wants to make more than
the sale of usage tokens. Trubanc uses the file system as a
database. One file in the Trubanc database costs one usage
token. Files vary in size, but are usually about 8K, mostly
signatures.
</p>

<p>
Note that Bob had to send his public key to the bank twice, once when
he requested the bank's public key, and again when he
registered. Every message going to and from Trubanc is digitally
signed. It's only possible to verify a digital signature if you know
the public key of the signer. A new customer's public key isn't in the
database until after he's registered, so the first two messages, in
which the new customer gets the bank's public key, so that he can
verify the bank's signatures, and the registration request, both need
to include the customers's public key, so that the signatures on those
two messages can themselves be verified. After registration is
complete, subsequent messages need to carry only the ID; the public
key can then be looked up in the database.
</p>

Actual messages sent (with the signature that goes with each
parenthesized item omitted):<br>

</pre>

<h2>Scenario: Receiving Assets</h2>

<p>
Bob: Hello bank. Here's my ID and a new request number. What's in my
inbox?<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: Your inbox contains a 50 usage token spend from Sue with a
message of "Hey Bob. Welcome to Trubanc!" It also contains a 10 usage
token charge from the bank with a message of "Registration Fee". Here
are two transaction numbers you can use to accept these spends and do
a spend yourself.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
Bob: Here's my ID and the first of the transaction numbers you gave
me. Accept the spend from Sue with a message of, "Thanks, Sue. I'm
excited about Trubanc!" Accept the bank charge. My balance after this
transaction will be 40 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bob
</p>

<p>
Bank: I've processed the spend from Sue and the bank charge. I agree
that your balance after that transaction is 40 usage tokens.<br/>
Signed: Bank
</p>

<p>
One possible attack on an electronic bank can be for someone to replay
an intercepted a message. Unless the protocol protects against that,
this can cause problems. Except for the bankid request, the
registration request, and a request for a customer's last request
number, every information request must be accompanied by a request
number that is larger than the customer's last used request number,
and every transaction must be accompanied by a transaction number that
is given out by the bank. The bank maintains a counter, which it
increments each time someone asks for a transaction number. This makes
requests that reveal information or initiate transactions impossible
to replay without a customer's passphrase and private key. In the
Trubanc world, your passphrase and your private key are your
identity. Guard them well.
</p>

<p>
Another possible replay attack is to intercept a message for one bank
and send it to another. Customers could protect against this by having
different IDs, hence different public/private key pairs, for different
banks. But it will be very convenient to use the same ID. Your friends
will recognize you, and you'll have only one passphrase to
remember. So the bank's ID is included in almost every request.
Requests meant for another bank will not work.
