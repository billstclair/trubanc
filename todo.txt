Error codes on $this->failmsg()

$t->SPEND
---------

Right now, spends to the bank are rejected right away.

Alternatives:

1) Accept spends to the bank right away, with no inbox or
outbox. Credit the bank's accounts.

2) Reject spends to the bank, but keep the proferred tokens. This would likely anger people, but possibly no more than losing tokens when another customer rejects your spend.
