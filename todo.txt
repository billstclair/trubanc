For spend
---------

Right now, spends to the bank are rejected right away.

Some alternatives:

1) Accept spends to the bank right away, with no inbox or outbox.

2) Reject spends to the bank, but keep the proferred tokens. This would likely anger people, but possibly no more than losing tokens when another customer rejects your spend.
