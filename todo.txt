Debug processinbox: spend|reject & acknowledgement of spend|reject

Remember the last successful spend or processinbox message and its result, and resend the result if the message is resent. This can heal responses that are lost in transit.

$t->SPEND
---------

Right now, spends to the bank are rejected right away.

Alternatives:

1) Accept spends to the bank right away, with no inbox or
outbox. Credit the bank's accounts.

2) Reject spends to the bank, but keep the proferred tokens. This would likely anger people, but possibly no more than losing tokens when another customer rejects your spend.
