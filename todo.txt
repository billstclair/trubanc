Remember the last successful spend or processinbox message and its result, and resend the result if the message is resent. This can heal responses that are lost in transit.

Credit the bank for usage tokens paid for files. Some of this may be already done, but that code needs reviewing.

Remove zero-balance files and credit a usage token. This requires a new message that captures all the files for, e.g., an account, so the customer can't claim a non-zero balance later on for the now missing file.

spend|cancel to take back a spend before the other guy has accepted or rejected it.

Support fees other than usage tokens.

Error codes on $this->failmsg()

$t->SPEND
---------

Right now, spends to the bank are rejected right away.

Alternatives:

1) Accept spends to the bank right away, with no inbox or
outbox. Credit the bank's accounts.

2) Reject spends to the bank, but keep the proferred tokens. This might anger some, but possibly no more than losing tokens when another customer rejects your spend.


Checks and Certificates
-----------------------

Have to keep external spend receipt until expiration date. Check or certificate costs a usage token, which is refunded on expiration. Thank you, Patrick!
