bankmsg() is quoting all the args. It should use match_pattern to
error check and determine which arg is a t->MSG. Don't quote that
one. This will require changes to unpack_bankmsg, since all the
parsing will be done with one call to $parser->parse().

$t->SPEND
---------

Right now, spends to the bank are rejected right away.

Alternatives:

1) Accept spends to the bank right away, with no inbox or
outbox. Credit the bank's accounts.

2) Reject spends to the bank, but keep the proferred tokens. This would likely anger people, but possibly no more than losing tokens when another customer rejects your spend.
