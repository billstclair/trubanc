This file contains instructions for installing a Trubanc server and client.

1) Get the contents of http://trubanc.com/trubanc.tar.gz into your web
   service directory. Or get it with git:

   git clone git://github.com/billstclair/trubanc.git trubanc

2) Copy settings.php.tmpl to settings.php, and edit it for your environment

3) To modify the home page, create a new home page HTML file (NOT
   index.html), and set the $index_file value in settings.php to
   its name. This file must be plain HTML. PHP will not be
   interpreted.

4) Copy client/settings.php.tmpl to client/settings.php, and edit it.

5) To modify the appearance of the client web page, copy
   client/template.php into a new php file in the same directory,
   change it, preserving the functionality of the variables documented
   at the top of the file, and set $template_file in
   client/settings.php to its name.

Notes
=====

$dbdir for both client and server must be writable by the web
server. The directories should not be directly servable by
Apache. Otherwise, people will be able to snoop on the "database", and
steal your bank's PGP private key, and information about customer
accounts. That would be bad.

If your installation doesn't allow you to have writable files anywhere
BUT the web server directory, you can create an .htaccess file in the
database directories, or a parent directory, containing the following,
to deny access to the database files from a web browser:

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule .* - [F]

To test your server installation, and generate the bank's private key,
aim your browser at:

  http://your-server.com/path/to/trubanc/?debug=true&msg=(0%2Cbankid%2C0):0

You should, after a few seconds to generate a key, output that looks
like:

  msg:

  (0,bankid,0):0

Some PHP SAFE_MODE installations will require you to set the
permission on the database directories to 2777, and enable
safe_mode_gid. If you see an error like the following, on entering the
URL above:

  Can't open for write: dbs/serverdb/pubkey/36a6db2903b42d35e753d44d95636490b0fb7b2c 

Then you should remove the server database directory, recreate it, and
change its permissions to 2777.

Once you've seen the "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" output above, your server is
working correctly. In order to get new users, you'll need a client
account for the server, so that you can mint coupons for them. To do
that, aim your browser at either the client on your web host, via
https, or a client installation on your PC. On the login page, click
the "Register a new account" link. On the registration page, enter a
new "Passphrase" for the bank's account, and again as the
"Verification", enter the server URL as the "Coupon", and paste the
server private key (see below) into the large text box at the bottom
of the page. Then click the "Create Account" button. You should see
the "Balance" screen with a "-0" balance for your bank's "Usage
Tokens".

After you've initialized your Trubanc server, and seen the "BEGIN
PUBLIC KEY" output above, you can find the bank private key in the
"privkey" file in the server database directory. Yes, there it is, in
plaintext. Much like SSL private keys in normal web server
environments. I plan to make a stand-alone server, that will require
the bank's passphrase to be entered when you start it up, and store
the plaintext bank private key only in RAM, but I haven't done that
yet.
