This file contains instructions for installing a Trubanc server and client.

1) Get the contents of http://trubanc.com/trubanc.tar.gz into your web
   service directory. Or get it with git:

   git clone git://github.com/billstclair/trubanc.git trubanc

2) Copy settings.php.tmpl to settings.php, and edit it for your environment

3) To modify the home page, create a new home page HTML file (NOT
   index.html), and set the $index_file value in settings.php to
   its name. This file must be plain HTML. PHP will not be
   interpreted.

4) Copy client/settings.php.tmpl to client/settings.php, and edit it.

5) To modify the appearance of the client web page, copy
   client/template.php into a new php file in the same directory,
   change it, preserving the functionality of the variables documented
   at the top of the file, and set $template_file in
   client/settings.php to its name.

Notes
=====

$dbdir for both client and server must be writable by the web
server. The directories should not be directly servable by
Apache. Otherwise, people will be able to snoop on the "database", and
steal your bank's PGP private key, and information about customer
accounts. That would be bad.
