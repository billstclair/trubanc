<h1>A Trubanc Web Client</h1>

<p>
I have written a <a href="./">Trubanc</a> web client, mostly as an
example of how to use the
<a href="viewtext.php?file=lib%2Fclient.php&search=&numbers=Yes">
client API</a>, but it's also a useful tool for maintaining multiple
Trubanc accounts on multiple Trubanc servers. This page uses sampled
screen-shots from the client to teach you how to use it. You can
follow those links within the text, or simply go to
<a href="./client/">Trubanc.com/client</a> to create a new account.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in technical details of what goes on behind the
scenes, this page is organized in about the same way as
<a href="plain-english.html">
Trubanc in Plain English</a>.

<p>
Disclaimer: This site has a fully-functional Trubanc client and
server, but you wouldn't want to store any real money here. First off,
you enter your passphrase into the client, unencrypted, so it's
visible to anyone who can see your web traffic. You COULD install the
client on your own computer and get rid of that problem, but the
Trubanc server on this machine is under development, so I may
occasionally break things. Plus, it's hosted on a machine in Arizona,
under the watchful guns of the United States government. They have a
nasty habit of deciding to steal people's property, because of made up
"crimes" of money laundering, or operating a money tranfer service
without a license. I hope that there will one day soon be many real
Trubanc servers to choose from, hosted outside of the influence of the
US government, and backed up daily to prevent lossage. For now,
though, please use this site to become accustomed to Trubanc, and to
help me test it.

<span class="summary-header">Note</span>
<p id="summary">
If you just want to learn the Trubanc web client by doing, follow the
directions in the gray boxes titled "Summary".
</p>

<h2>Opening an Account</h2>

<p>
When you first go to the client web page, you'll see the
<a href="demo/">Login screen</a>. Once you've created an account,
simply enter your passphrase and press the "Login" key (or the "Enter"
or "Return" key on your keyboard). But first, you need to create
public key pair.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc uses
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/">
public key</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">
cryptography</a> to identify you in all communication with the server,
and to ensure that the server you reach over the internet today is the
same one you reached yesterday. With Trubanc, your private key,
stored, encrypted with your passphrase, on the machine that hosts the
client, <i>is</i> your identity. Guard it well. And if you're
connecting to a real Trubanc server, install the client on your own
machine. Don't use a public web client, like the one on this
site. Protect your passphrase like your gold. If somebody gets it, and
your passphrase, they are <i>you</i> as far as a Trubanc server is
concerned. But without it, <i>nobody</i> can impersonate you.
</p>

<p>
To create your identity, you must first pick a passphrase. This should
be a longish sequence of words that you can remember, but that it
would be unlikely for anyone to guess. It's best to use your memory,
not a piece of paper, to remember your passphrase. Pick a good one,
and don't forget it. If you do, you've lost your identity and access
to any assets stored in accounts keyed to it. Unless you picked a
really easy passphrase, nobody can recover it for you. That's a good
thing.
</p>

<p>
In order to protect this web site from spammers, you'll also need to
enter an "Invitation token". This is a 40-character string that I'll
send to you if you ask. Email billstclair at gmail dot com. Or Skype
billstclair.
</p>

<p>
Enter your passphrase twice, once in the "Passphrase" field, and again
in the "Verification" field. Enter the "Invitation token". Pick a "Key
size". RSA labs
<a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2004">thinks</a> that
a key size of 3072 bits should be secure until beyond the year
2031. So that's the default. Smaller sizes are a little faster to
generate, and use, but only a little. It hardly matters for a key that
you'll only be using on this site to play with the interface. Finally,
press the "Create account" button.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Ask billstclair at gmail dot com for an invitation token</li>
<li>Pick a passphrase</li>
<li>Go to
<a href="client/">trubanc.com/client</a></li>
<li>Enter your "Passphrase" and "Verification"</li>
<li>Enter the "Invitation token"</li>
<li>Press the "Create account" button</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a Bank</h2>

<p>
The
<a href="demo/banks.html">
Banks page</a> will be your first landing spot after creating a new
account. Until you've registered at a bank, you can't do much. It
costs "usage tokens" to join a bank. Somebody has to give them or sell
them to you. The bank at this site charges 10 usage tokens to create
an account, and 1 token for each server file your account uses. In
order to get some tokens, you'll have to ask me to fund your
account. Use the contact info above to send me the long string of hex
digits (0-9 and a-f) that you see after "Your ID". I'll gift you 100
usage tokens ("Trubanc Asset Tokens") and 10 "Bill Fake GoldGrams", so
you can play. I'll be creating bearer certificates pretty soon, which
will take the place of the invitation token and of this second
contact. You'll be able to forge them for your friends, if you have
enough usage tokens.
</p>

<p>
After I've notified you that I've funded your account, enter
"http://trubanc.com" as the "Bank URL", and, if you want, an "Account
Name". That name will be part of your ID at the bank. Anybody who
knows your ID and has an account will see it. There is currently no
way to change it, but I may add that, if there's demand. Press the
"Add Bank" button, and you should be taken to the
<a href="balance.html">
Balance page</a>.

<li>Enter "http://trubanc.com" as the "Bank URL"</li>
<li>Enter an "Account Name", if you want to identify yourself with
other than your ID</li>
<li>Press the "Add Bank" button</li>
