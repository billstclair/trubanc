<h1>A Trubanc Web Client</h1>

<p>
I have written a <a href="./">Trubanc</a> web client, mostly as an
example of how to use the
<a href="viewtext.php?file=lib%2Fclient.php&search=&numbers=Yes">
client API</a>, but it's also a useful tool for maintaining multiple
Trubanc accounts on multiple Trubanc servers. This page uses sampled
screen-shots from the client to teach you how to use it. You can
follow those links within the text, or simply go to
<a href="./client/">Trubanc.com/client</a> to create a new account.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in technical details of what goes on behind the
scenes, this page is organized in about the same way as
<a href="plain-english.html">
Trubanc in Plain English</a>.

<p>
Disclaimer: This site has a fully-functional Trubanc client and
server, but you wouldn't want to store any real money here. First off,
you enter your passphrase into the client, unencrypted, so it's
visible to anyone who can see your web traffic. You COULD install the
client on your own computer and get rid of that problem, but the
Trubanc server on this machine is under development, so I may
occasionally break things. Plus, it's hosted on a machine in Arizona,
under the watchful guns of the United States government. They have a
nasty habit of deciding to steal people's property, because of made up
"crimes" of "money laundering", or "operating a money tranfer service
without a license" or "tax evasion". I hope that there will one day
soon be many real Trubanc servers to choose from, hosted outside of
the influence of the US government, and backed up daily to prevent
lossage. For now, though, please use this site only to become
accustomed to Trubanc, and to help me test it.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Note</span>
<p id="summary">
If you just want to learn the Trubanc web client by doing, follow the
directions in the gray boxes titled "Summary".
</p>

<h2>Opening an Account</h2>

<p>
When you first go to the client web page, you'll see the
<a href="demo/">Login screen</a>. Once you've created an account,
simply enter your passphrase and click the "Login" button (or press
the "Enter" or "Return" key on your keyboard). But first, you need to
create public key pair. Click the "Register a new account" link on the
login screen to go to the
<a href="demo/register.html">
Registration screen</a>.
</p>

<p>
Trubanc uses
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/">
public key</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">
cryptography</a> to identify you in all communication with the server,
and to ensure that the server you reach over the internet today is the
same one you reached yesterday. With Trubanc, your private key,
stored, encrypted with your passphrase, on the machine that hosts the
client, <i>is</i> your identity. Guard it well. I will soon write
instructions for installing the client on your PC. But if you use one
over the internet, make sure it's over an encrypted (https)
link. Protect your passphrase like your gold. If somebody gets it, and
your encrypted private key, or access to a public client site holding
your private key, they are <i>you</i> as far as a Trubanc server is
concerned. But without it, <i>nobody</i> can impersonate you.
</p>

<p>
To create your identity, you must first pick a passphrase. This should
be a longish sequence of words that you can remember, but that it
would be unlikely for anyone to guess. It's best to use your memory,
not a piece of paper, to remember your passphrase. Pick a good one,
and don't forget it. If you do, you've lost your identity and access
to any assets stored in accounts keyed to it. Unless you picked a
really easy passphrase, nobody can recover it for you. That's a good
thing. There's a random-word passphrase generator on the
<a href="https://loom.cc/?function=folder_tools">
Loom Tools</a> page. Press the "Random" button in the "Passphrase"
line.
</p>

<p>
In order to protect Trubanc clients and servers from spammers, you'll
also need to enter a "Coupon". A Trubanc coupon is a portable store of
value. Coupons are usually used to give usage tokens to people who
want to open new accounts, but they can be minted in any asset
type. After you use one you get from a friend or the bank proprieter
to create an account, you can mint your own on the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
balance screen</a>, and fund new accounts for your friends.
</p>

<p>
Enter your passphrase twice, once in the "Passphrase" field, and again
in the "Verification" field. Paste your "Coupon". Pick a "Key
size". RSA Labs
<a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2004">thinks</a> that
a key size of 3072 bits should be secure until beyond the year
2031. So that's the default. Smaller sizes are a little faster to
generate, and use, but only a little. It hardly matters for a key that
you'll only be using on this site to play with the interface. Finally,
press the "Create account" button. It takes a few seconds to generate
a new passphrase, so be patient.

<h2>Receiving Assets</h2>

<p>
The
<a href="demo/balance.html">Balance screen</a> is where you spend most
of your quality Trubanc time. It lets you see spends from others that
you haven't yet acknowledged, spends from yourself that the recipient
has acknowledged and you haven't yet completed, and your current
balances in all the assets you possess. It also has a "Show raw
balance" link, which brings up the
<a href="demo/rawbalance.html">
raw balance screen</a>. This shows the low-level encodings of the
signed and countersigned messages in your inbox, outbox, and
balances. Unless you're a Trubanc developer, you probably won't need
to look at this much.
</p>

<p>
After you add a new bank, you'll see at least two spends. One will be
from the coupon from your sponsor, for enough usage tokens to cover the
registration fee. The other will be a negative spend from the bank for
that registration fee. In Trubanc, the bank can't simply change your
balance behind your back. All balances and spends are signed by you
and countersigned by the bank. So in order to change your balance, you
must explicity make or accept spends. If someone spends assets to you
that you don't want, e.g. to purchase something that you no longer
sell, you can choose to reject that spend.
</p>

<p>
A Trubanc transaction has three steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A makes a spend to B.</li>
<li>B accepts or rejects the spend.</li>
<li>A closes the transaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The "<b>=== Inbox ===</b>" section of the balance screen has six
columns:
<ol>
<li><b>Request:</b> this is "Spend" for spends other people made to you, or
  "Accept" or "Reject" for acknowledgements of spends you made to
  others.</li>
<li><b>From:</b> This contains the name or ID of the other person. If
  you've given him a nickname on the
<a href="demo/contacts.html">Contacts screen</a>, that will appear. If
he also has an account name, that will appear in parentheses. If the
other person is not amongst your contacts, a "Nickname" text box
will allow you to add him.</li>
<li><b>Amount:</b> The amount that was spent in this transaction. If
  you see "<span style="color: red;"><i>(new)</i></span>" after the
  asset name, that means that you have never credited any amounts of
  this asset type to your account. This can help you avoid accepting
  counterfeit assets (same name, but different ID).</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> The note in the original spend for this
  transaction. For acknowledgement lines, this is your original spend note.</li>
<li><b>Action:</b> the action you want to perform on this line when
  you press the "Process Inbox" button.</li>
<li><b>Reply:</b> you may type a reply here for spends, and you'll see
  the other person's reply here for acknowledgements of your spends.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To accept or reject or skip a spend, select what you want to do in
each row's "Action" column. To prevent the server database from
filling up, you're not allowed to do a new spend until you've cleared
your inbox, but you can keep some spends around until then by skipping
them.
</p>

<p>
To remove a spend acknowledgement from your inbox, closing the
transaction, check the "Remove" box in its "Action" column.
</p>

<p>
Click the "Process Inbox" button to perform the corresponding "Action"
to each row.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Go to the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
Balance screen</a>.
<li>In the "Action" column, select an action for each spend and unclick
  the "Remove" boxes for acknowledgements you wish to keep.</li>
<li>Type a "Reply" for each accepted or rejected spend that needs
  one.</li>
<li>Click the "Process Inbox" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding Contacts</h2>

<p>
The Trubanc server keeps track of customers by their ID, the SHA1 hash of
their public keys. Remembering 40-character hex strings tends to be
hard for most of us humans, though, so the web client allows you to
associate nicknames with your contacts. The
<a href="demo/contacts.html">
Contacts screen</a> shows you contacts that you have added in the past
and allows you to add new ones. This is so simple that I'll just put
it in the summary. You can also add a contact from the "Inbox" section
of the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
Balance screen</a>, or during a spend, by fillin in the "Nickname" box
in the inbox "From" column. or near the bottom of the spend form. This
will add a new contact with a blank nickname and notes. You'll
probably want to visit the Contacts screen to add those, especially if
the customer has no Account Name.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Go to the
<a href="demo/contacts.html">
Contacts screen</a>.
<li>Paste your contact's "ID".<li>
<li>If you want, type a "Nickname".</li>
<li>If you want, type some "Notes".</li>
<li>Press the "Add/Change Contact" button.</li>
<li>If the ID is new, a contact will be added. If it already exists,
  the Nickname and Notes of the existing contact will be updated, if
  non-blank. To remove a nickname or note, type a single space in that
  field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spending Assets</h2>

<p>
All tranfers are sent and received on the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
Balance screen</a>. The "Receiving Assets" section above dealt with
the "Inbox", This section deals with the "Balances" and "Outbox"
sections.
</p>

<p>
Spends are pretty well documented below the "Balances" and spend form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To make a spend, fill in the "Spend amount", choose a "Recipient" or
enter a "Recipient ID, enter (optionally) a "Note", and click the
"Spend" button next to the asset you wish to spend.
</p>

<p>
To transfer balances, enter the "Spend Amount", select or fill-in the
"Transfer to" name (letters, numbers, and spaces only), and click the
"Spend" button next to the asset you want to transfer from. Each
storage location costs one usage token, and there is currently no way
to recover an unused location. 0 balances will show only on the raw
balance screen.
</p>

<p>
To mint a coupon, enter the "Spend Amount", check the "Mint coupon"
box, and click the "Spend" button next to the asset you want to
transfer to the coupon. You can redeem a coupon on the "Banks" page.
</p>

<p>
Entering a "Nickname" will add the "Recipient ID" to your contacts
list with that nickname, or change the nickname of the selected
"Recipient".
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Trubanc lets you split up your balances into multiple
sub-accounts. You start off with just one, named "main". You can add
more by tranferring to them as described above.
</p>

<p>
The "Outbox" section, below the spend instructions shows pending
spends and coupons. The word "coupon" is a link to a page that shows
that coupon, for easy copy and paste. When you mint a coupon, you'll
be taken automatically to the new coupon's page. To redeem a coupon,
paste it into the "Bank URL or Coupon" box on the
<a href="demo/banks.html">
Banks screen</a>, and click the "Add bank" button.
</p>

<p>
Spends that have not yet been accepted or rejected, and coupons that
have not yet been redeemed, can be cancelled by pressing the "Cancel"
button in that row of the "Outbox" section. Cancelled spends will come
into your inbox just as if the recipient had rejected them, except the
bank will pocket the transaction fee, to discourage this as a regular
practice. Cancelled coupons will come into your inbox as a regular
spend, as if you had redeemed the coupon. You'll need to accept the
spend, and acknowledge the acceptance, as two "Process Inbox" button
presses.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Go to the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
Balance screen</a>.</li>
<li>Enter the "Spend amount".</li>
<li>Choose a "Recipient" or paste in his "Recipient ID".</li>
<li>Type a "Nickname" if you want to add or change it.</li>
<li>Click the "Spend" button next to the asset you want to spend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a Bank</h2>

<p>
To create an account at a new bank, or add an existing bank account to
a new client, use the
<a href="demo/banks.html">
Banks screen</a>. To create a new account, or to redeem it in an
existing account, paste a coupon into "Bank URL or Coupon". For a
new account, if you want the account to be named, enter an "Account
name". To add an existing account at another bank to a client that
doesn't have it, enter the bank's URL as the "Bank URL or Coupon",
instead of a coupon. Then press the "Add Bank" button.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Acquire a coupon with usage tokens for the new bank.
<li>Go to the
<a href="client/?cmd=banks">Banks screen</a>.</li>
<li>Paste the coupon into "Bank URL or Coupon".</li>
<li>Enter an "Account Name", if you want to identify yourself with
other than your ID.</li>
<li>Press the "Add Bank" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preventing Spam</h2>

<p>
Since a spend requires two files, an outbox entry for the spender and
an inbox entry for the recipient, the spender is charged two usage
tokens to make the spend. That pays the bank for disk space (storage
fees and non-refundable transaction fees will come soon). If the
recipient accepts the spend, the spender will get those usage tokens
back when he closes the transaction. If the recipient rejects the
spend, he, not the spender, gets the usage tokens.
</p>

<p>
A zero spend, with an attached note is very similar to an email. If it
were free, spammers would be able to fill your Trubanc inbox with
garbage. Since rejecting that spam message will cost the spammer two
tokens, it will cost him money to keep doing it. This should
discourage spam. I'll eventually add a feature where you can choose to
give back the usage tokens with a rejected spend. Until then, you'll
need to explicitly spend them back, except to spammers. An easy way to
spend back usage tokens is to do a zero spend with a note to the
recipient to reject the spend and take the tokens.
</p>

<h2>Issuing Assets</h2>

<p>
Many Trubanc banks will issue their own assets. Many of the existing
digital gold currencies work that way. But, like
<a href="https://loom.cc/">Loom</a>, Trubanc allows anyone to issue a
currency. If you convince enough people that your currency is stable
and accepted by enough people, they'll use it. Creating your new asset
type is very easy. On the
<a href="demo/assets.html">
Assets screen</a>, you'll see a list of all the assets that are or
ever were in your account. You can fill in the form with your new
asset's "Scale", "Precision", and "Asset Name", and press the "Add
Asset" button. "Scale" is the number of digits kept track
of to the right of the decimal point. "Precision" is the minimum
number of decimal places that will be printed, even if they're all
zero. "Scale" must be greater than or equal to "Precision". Most
GoldGram-like curencies use a scale of 7 and a precision of 3. The
"Asset name" can be whatever you like. In the demo Trubanc, it costs
two usage tokens to create a new asset type.
</p>

<p>
When you create a new asset, it will appear in your "main"
sub-account, with a balance of "-0". Negative balances are for assets
you issue. You can spend as much of such an asset as you like, but
people will trust your asset a lot better if you never spend more of
it that you can back with the commodity you've choosen to back it.
</p>

<p>
You can move asset issuance to another sub-account, or transfer it to
another person, by doing a spend for the entire negative amount. So,
right after asset creation, when your balance is "-0.000" in  your
"main" sub-account, you can type "-0" as the "Spend amount" on the
<a href="demo/balance.html">
Balance screen</a>, and select either a "Recipient" or a "Transfer to"
sub-account. If you transfer issuance to another person, you'll likely
want to inform your asset holders of the change. It could have an
effect on the perceived value of your asset.
</p>

<span class="summary-header">Summary</span>
<ul id="summary">
<li>Go to the
<a href="demo/assets.html">
Assets page</a>.</li>
<li>Enter a "Scale", "Precision", and "Asset name".</li>
<li>Press the "Add Asset" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping History</h2>

<p>I plan to add history to the client soon. Until then, once you've
  cleared a transaction from your account, it's gone.</p>
