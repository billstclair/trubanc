Trubanc is an anonymous, digitally-signed vault and trading
system. Like <a href="https://loom.cc/">Loom</a>, it allows anyone to
issue assets (digital currencies). Unlike Loom, which relies entirely
on (very good) obscurity for security, Trubanc's digital signatures
allow the bank and the customer to prove to each other that they
agreed at a particular time on their balances. It does this while
allowing destruction of transaction history for closed trades. Trubanc
will initially provide server-based trading. Eventually, it will
provide digital checks and bearer certificates. These, however, WILL
require permanent storage of transaction history.
