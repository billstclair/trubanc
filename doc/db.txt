setup.php defines the $dbdir, which is the base of the database in the
file system. Here's how the bank directory is structured.

Items in angle brackets are variables
Items not in angle brackets are literals
"--" comment to the end of the line
<dir>/ is a directory
<key>=<value> is a file named <key> with contents <value>
Items whose names end with "#" are sequence numbers.
name:<item> denotes an optional item, passed by position or name
Items in parens  are signed. Signature omitted here.

=== Transactions ===


Look up pubkey
--------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,id,<id2>)

  Use 0 for <id2> to look up the bank's key.
  If there is such an id registered, bank responds with:

(<id2>,register,<pubkey>,name=<name>)

  If there is no such id, bank responds with:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,id,<id2>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)

  A note about looking up the bank's public key. It can only be done
  by registered customers. If an unregistered customer sends
  (<id>,id,0), the <id> will be unknown, so the signature verification
  of the message will fail.


Create account
--------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,register,<pubkey>,name=<name>)

  If the id is new, matches the pubkey, the signature is OK, and the
  customer has enough usage tokens in his inbox (spending usage tokens
  to a new <id> is how the account directory is actually created),
  bank adds a negative spend for the registration tokens to customer's
  inbox, and responds with:

(<bankid>,register,<bank_pubkey>,name=<bankname>)

  This is the first time the bank will have seen the customer's
  pubkey.  The parsing code notices these "id" messages, and verifies
  pubkey if unknown, before using it to verify the registration
  message itself.  Customer will need to process his inbox to transfer
  his introduction tokens, and the bank's charges against them, to his
  balance. Banks can choose to put negative spends in your inbox to
  charge periodic fees. You usually won't be able to spend an asset
  to anyone but the asset issuer until you pay those fees. Banks can
  also choose to allow negative spends from any customer to
  another. This is a request for money, and can be denied like any
  other spend.

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,register,<pubkey>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)

  Note that pubkeys bigger than 4096 bits won't be accepted. Really
  big keys are a good way to DOS attack the server.

  Note that the customer won't be able to verify the signature on the
  failed message, since he doesn't know the bank's public key, and
  can't get it until he has successfully completed his registration.


Get Req
-------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,getreq,<random>)

  Bank sends:

(<bankid>,req,<req#>)

  Note that this request can be replayed. The customer needs to have
  some way of getting back in sync for requests. This is it.
  It makes no changes to the server database, just returns the
  customer's most recent request <req#>.


Get timestamp
-------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,time,<req#>)

  Bank compares <req#> to /accounts/<id>/req. If <req#> is greater,
  bank sets /account/<id>/req to <req#>, increments /time to <time#>,
  sets /account/<id>/time to <time#>, and returns:

(<bankid>,time,<time#>)

  Otherwise, bank returns

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,time,<req#>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)

  Note that this always creates a new <time#>, larger than any
  timestamp in the bank. If the cusomter didn't use the last <time#>
  returned from this request, it is overwritten, and can no longer be
  used.

Get fees
--------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,getfees,<req#>,operation=<operation>)

  Bank compares <req#> to /account/<id>/req. If <req#>
  is greater, bank sets /account/<id>/req to <req#>,
  increments /time to <time#>, and returns /regfeesig,
  /tranfeesig, and /feesig/<operation>, or all feesig
  items if operation is not included.

(<bankid>regfee,<time#>,0,<amount>).
  (<bankid>,tranfee,<time2#>,0,<amount>).
  (<bankid>,fee|<operation>,<time3#>,<assetid>,<amount>).
  (<bankid>,fee|<operation2>,<time4#>,assetid2>,<amount2>).
  ...
  (<bankid>,fee|<operationN>,<timeN#>,<assetidN>,<amountN>)

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,getfees,<operation>,<req#>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)


Spend
-----

  Customer sends the following. Second and subsequent balance items
  are for the fee assets. Customer can pick whatever accounts he likes
  for the fees to be taken from. The bank figures out if it can make
  it work.

(<id>,spend,<time#>,<id2>,<assetid>,<amount>,note:<note>>).
  (<id>,balance,<time#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct>).
  (<id>,balance,<time#>,assetid2>,<amount2>,acct:<acct2>).
  ...
  (<id>,balance,<time#>,<assetidN>,<amountN>,acct:<acctN>).
  (<id>,outboxhash,<time#>,<outboxhash>)

  Bank checks that the <time#> is equal to /account/<id>/time, that
  the balances match (after subtracting the spend amount fees), and
  that the hash of all the outbox entries (after adding the new one),
  sorted numerically by <time#>, match what the customer sent. If they
  match, bank sets /account/<id>/time to 0, stores the spend in
  /account/<id>/outbox/<time#> and /account/<id2>/inbox/<time#>, sets
  the /account/<id>/balance/<acct>/<assetid> to the customer's balance
  items, updates /account/<id>/hash with the customer's hash item, and
  sends:

(<bankid>,@spend,(<id>,spend,<time#>,<id2>,<assetid>,<amount>,note:<note>,acct:<acct>)).
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,balance,<time#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct>)).
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,balance,<time#>,assetid2>,<amount2>,acct:<acct2>)).
  ...
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,balance,<time#>,<assetidN>,<amountN>,acct:<acctN>)).
  (<bankid>,@outboxhash,(<id>,outboxhash,<time#>,<hash>))

If they don't match, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,spend,<time#>,<id2>,<assetid>,<amount>,note:<note>,acct:<acct>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)


Query Inbox
------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,inbox,<req#>)

  Bank compares <req#> to /account/<id>/req. If <req#>
  is greater, bank sets /account/<id>/req to <req#> and
  responds with contents of /account/<id>/inbox/, separated by
  periods:

(<bankid>,inbox,<req#>).
  <time6#>=(bankid,inbox,<time6#>,(<id2>,spend|accept,<time2#>,note:<note22>,acct:<acct2>)).
  <time7#>=(bankid,inbox,<time7#>,(<id3>,spend|reject,<time3#>,note:<note32>)).
  <time8#>=(bankid,inbox,<time8#>,(<id4>,spend,<time4#>,note:<note4>)).
  <time9#>=(bankid,inbox,<time9#>,(<id5>,spend,<time5#>,note:<note5>))

  Otherwise, bank sends:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,inbox,<req#>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)

  If the inbox is not empty, bank will ensure that there are two
  timestamps in /account/<id>/time, one for processing the inbox, and
  one for doing a spend. The customer doesn't have to do either, but
  he will often want to. The bank will not allow a spend to be done if
  there are any inbox entries with a bank-signed timestamp less than
  /account/<id>/last. This forces customers to complete inbox
  transactions, and be in sync with the bank about their balances and
  outbox contents, if they want to be able to do spends. There is one
  exception. The customer will always be allowed to spend each assetid
  to the issuer of that assetid, so that there's always a way to "cash
  out". Since the bank signs all incoming inbox entries, with a newly
  allocated timestamp, if the customer gets two timestamps before
  processing the inbox, then any inbox entries that arrive before his
  inbox processing and subsequent spend are done will have timestamps
  greater than the two put ther by the inbox query, so he'll be
  allowed to use the second one for a spend, even if his inbox is very
  busy.

Process Inbox
-------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,processinbox,<time8#>,<time6#>|<time7#>|<time8#>|<time9#>).
  (<id>,spend|accept,<id4>,<time4#>,note:<note42>).
  (<id>,spend|reject,<id5>,<time5#>,note:<note52>).
  (<id>,balance,<time8#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct>).
  (<id>,balance,<time8#>,assetid2>,<amount2>,acct:<acct2>).
  ...
  (<id>,balance,<time8#>,<assetidN>,<amount3>,acct:<acctN>).
  (<id>,outboxhash,<time8#>,<hash>)

Bank compares <time8#> to /account/<id>/time. If it's the same. Bank
processes the requested inbox transaction2, and compares the result to
the balances and outboxhash sent by customer. If correct, bank sets
/account/<id>/last to <time8#>, sets /account/<id>/time to 0, removes
the transaction from /account/<id>/inbox/, removes completed
transactions from /account/<id>/outbox/, signs and adds spend|accept
and spend|reject items to the other customers' inboxes, updates the
/account/<id>/balance/<acctN>/<assetidN> with the balances the
customer sent, updates /account/<id>/outboxhash with the outboxhash
item the customer sent, and sends back:

(<bankid,@processinbox,(<id>,processinbox,<time8#>,<time7#>|<time8#>|<time9#>).
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,<time8#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct>)).
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,balance,<time8#>,assetid2>,<amount2>,acct:<acct2>)).
  ...
  (<bankid>,@balance,(<id>,balance,<time8#>,<assetidN>,<amount3>,acct:<acctN>)).
  (<bankid>,@outboxhash,(<id>,outboxhash,<time8#>,<hash>))

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,removeinbox,<time2#>|<time3#>|<time4#>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)

This is the most complicated function in the system. It has to deal
with two kinds of inbox items. The first is spontaneous spends from
another customer. These get deposited in your account if you
accept. Whether accepted or rejected gets put in the other guys inbox,
where it becomes the second type of inbox item. These acknowledge
earlier spends. When you process one of them, it and the corresponding
outbox item can be removed, forever.

Note that the customer decides which <acct> names will get the spends
and the usage token refunds by where he specifies the balances in the
"balance" items. The bank only verifies that the assets can be
distributed as the customer requested.

Rejected spends credit the usage tokens to the recipient, not the
spender. This discourages spam, even in an otherwise free bank.


Lookup asset
------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,getasset,<req#>,<assetid>)

  Bank compares <req#> to /account/<id>/req. If <req#>
  is greater, bank sets /account/<id>/req to <req#>. Then,
  if <assetid> exists in /asset, bank returns:

(<bankid>,affirm,(<issuerid>,asset,<assetid>,<assetname>))

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,getasset,<assetid>,<random>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)


Create asset
------------

  Customer sends:

(<id>,asset,<assetid>,<scale>,<precision>,<assetname>).
  (<id>,balance,<time4#>,<assetid>,-1,acct:<acct1>).
  (<id>,balance,<time4#>,assetid2>,<amount2>acct:<acct2>).
  ...
  (<id>,balance,<time4#>,<assetidN>,<amountN>,acct:<acctN>).
  
  Note that the balance for the new asset is "-1". Like loom, the sum
  of all balances for an <assetid> add up to -1. A negative balance
  means that the owner is the issuer (except negative balances in the
  usage token can exist during registration). I haven't worked out the
  process to switch issuer ownership.

  If <assetid> is the hash of <id><scale><precision><assetname>,
  /asset/<assetid> does not exist, <time4#> is greater than
  /account/<id>/time, and the customer has properly subtracted the
  createasset fees from the balances in /account/<id>/balance/<acctN>
  (including a balance of -1 for the new asset), then bank adds
  <assetid>=(<id>,asset,<assetid>,<scale>,<precision>,<assetname>) to
  /asset/, adds <assetname>=<assetid> to /assetname/, and returns:

(<bankid>,affirm,(<id>,asset,<assetid>,<assetname>)).
  (<bankid>,balance,<time4#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct1>).
  (<bankid>,balance,<time4#>,assetid2>,<amount2>acct:<acct2>).
  ...
  (<bankid>,balance,<time4#>,<assetidN>,<amountN>,acct:<acctN>)

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,asset,<assetid>,<assetname>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)


Get outbox
----------

  If customer encounters an outbox hash mismatch, customer can send:

(<id>,getoutbox,<req#>)

  Bank compares <req#> to /account/<id>/req. If <req#>
  is greater, bank sets /account/<id>/req to <req#>. Then,
  if the <id> exists, bank returns:

(<bankid>,outbox,<req#>).
  (<id>,spend,<time2#>,<id2>,<assetid>,<amount>,note:<note>,acct:<name>).
  (<id>,spend,<time3#>,<id3>,<assetid3>,<amount3>,note:<note3>,acct:<acct3>).
  ...
  (<bankid>,outboxhash,<time#>,<hash>)

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,getoutbox,<req#>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)


Get balance
-----------

  If the customer loses track of a balance, customer can send:

(<id>,getbalance,<req#>,acct:<acct>,assetid:<assetid>)

  <acct> can be "*" to return balances of all accounts. Bank compares
  <req#> to /account/<id>/req. If <req#> is greater, bank sets
  /account/<id>/req to <req#>.  Then bank returns information about
  the specified <acct>s and <assetid>s If acct is not specified then
  information about all accounts is returned. If assetid is not
  specified, then information about all assetids is returned.

(<id>,balance,<time#>,<assetid>,<amount>,acct:<acct>)...

  Otherwise, bank returns:

(<bankid>,failed,(<id>,getbalance,<req#>,acct:<acct>),errcode:<errcode>,reason:<reason>)
